According to this picture Lithium has an atomic mass of 6.941 amu. The atomic mass is also referred to as the molecular mass (amu). Therefore the molecular mass of Lithium is 6.941 amu. Molar mass is molecular mass in grams per mole of a substance. Therefore the molar mass of one mole of Lithium is 6.941 g/mol. According to the picture, how many significant digits are present in the atomic mass? 3. In the equation above you were calculating the amount of Lithium in 3.5 moles of Li; If the T-chart is a way to show the conversion from amount of moles to amount of grams in Li, the units being canceled out are mol and the units are you looking for are grams. What operation is being done with the fractions above? Multiplication.

1.  Raise your hand to get the questions looked over. If the teacher sees everything is correct your group may move on to the lab portion. Please make sure you are wearing aprons and goggles. However before you can get to the lab stations your group must draw what each ionic salt above would look like for the lewis dot structure. Your group must also determine the type of intermolecular force present.
