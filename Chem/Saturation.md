Saturation is the amount of solute dissolved in a solution.
Solubility is how much solute dissolves in a given amount of solvent.
For most solids, higher temperature means higher solubility.
An unsaturated solution can still hold more solute at that temperature.
A saturated solution holds the maximum amount of solute it can have at that temperature.
If extra solute is added to a saturated solution, it does not dissolve. This is an unsaturated solution.
