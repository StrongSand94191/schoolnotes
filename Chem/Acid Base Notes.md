# Properties of Acids
- Acids are proton donors
- Acids have a pH lower than 7
- Acids taste sour
- Acids affect indicators
	- Blue litmus turns red
	- Methyl orange turns red
- Acids react with active metals, producing H2 (replacement reaction)
	- Mg + 2HCl -> MgCl2 + H2(g)
		- One mole of magnesium reacts with two moles of hydrochloric acid, forming one mole of magnesium chloride and one mole of hydrogen gas
	- Zn + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2(g)
		- One mole of zinc reacts with two moles of hydrochloric acid, forming one mole of zinc chloride and one mole of hydrogen gas
	- Mg + H2SO4 -> MgSO4 + H2(g)
		- One mole of magnesium reacts with one mole of sulfuric acid, forming one mole of magnesium sulfate and one mole of hydrogen gas
- Acids react with carbonates
- Acids neutralize bases
- Strong acids are assumed to be 100% ionized in solution (good donors)
- Weak acids are usually less than 5% ionized in solution (bad donors)
- A single bond is a sigma bond
- A double bond is a sigma pi
