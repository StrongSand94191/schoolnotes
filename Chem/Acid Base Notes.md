# Properties of Acids
- Acids are proton donors
- Acids have a pH lower than 7
- Acids taste sour
- Acids affect indicators
	- Blue litmus turns red
	- Methyl orange turns red
- Acids react with active metals, producing H2
	- Mg + 2HCl -> MgCl2 + H2(g)
	- Zn + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2(g)
	- Mg + H2SO4 ->
- Acids react with carbonates
- Acids neutralize bases
- Strong acids are assumed to be 100% ionized in solution (good donors)
- Weak acids are usually less than 5% ionized in solution (bad donors)
- A single bond is a sigma bond
- A double bond is a sigma pi
