## Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment
- Alpha:
Helium (mass of 4, atomic number of 2)

1/1000 times, alpha particle (helium) was deflected when fired at nuclei 
Concluded that the nucleus is very small and desnse

|Particle|Charge|Mass (kg)|Location|
|--|--|--|--|
|Electron|-1|9.109e-31|Electron cloud|
|Proton|1|1.673e-27|Nucleus|
|Neutron|0|1.675e-27|Nucleus|

Memorize prefixes from tera- to pico-

Isotopes are atoms of the same element haivng different masses due to varying numbers of neutrons.
