1. Political parties today are far more divided.
2. We've always had a divided two-party system because our first-past-the-post voting system encourages voters to only vote for one of two candidates, because supporting a less popular candidate usually means that you're throwing away your vote. This could be remedied with a better voting system like ranked vote.
